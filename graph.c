// Practice graph questions for Week 12 Prac Exam
// Written by Paul Wochnowski and Brittany Evat

/* --------------- README --------------
 * A quick note before you begin these questions,
 * it's very strongly recommended that you work these out on pen and paper
 * before actually coding, figure out what edge cases there are, and just
 * work through some of those logically on paper.
 * These questions (tree questions) in particular are typical interview questions.
 * If you're into role playing (or not), try and practice speaking out your thoughts
 * the whole time as you're doing these questions on paper/coding. This is what
 * the interviewer wants to see, your thinking process. It'll also help you maintain
 * focus and pick up errors which you would otherwise miss.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging is pretty legit

/* 
 * Easy Questions 
 */

// Write a function which takes in a Graph g, and returns 1 if
// the graph has a cycle, 0 otherwise

int hasCycle(Graph g) {

  return 0;
}

// Write a function which takes in 
// g : a Graph
// s : a starting Vertex
// d : maximum distance from the starting Vertex
// vs : the address of an array of Vertex values
// and stores in vs all vertices which lie within a distance d of the
// start vertex, and returns a count of the number of Vertex values
// stored in the array.
// (Distance is measured in number of edges on the shortest path
// from the starting vertex)

int within(Graph g, Vertex s, int d, Vertex *vs) {

  return 0;
}



/*
 * Medium Questions
 */

// Write a function which takes in a Graph g and returns a 
// vertex-indexed connected components array
// e.g. a graph with the following adjacency matrix representation 
// 0 1 0 0
// 1 0 0 0
// 0 0 0 1
// 0 0 1 0
// would return the following array:
// [0, 0, 1, 1]
// i.e. vertices 0 and 1 are in the first connected component (represented by 0 in the array), and
// vertices 2 and 3 are in the second connected component (represented by 1)

  return NULL;
}


/* 
  Create a bipartition of the graph.

  Determine whether it is possible to split the vertices of a graph into two lists L1 and L2, such that no pair of vertices in the same list are connected by an edge in the graph. 
  If this is possible, return 1 and store the two partitions seperately in either L1 or L2. 
  If it is not possible, return 0.

  For example consider the following graph:

  1  -> 2  -> 5
              ^
  |           |
  v           v
  4 <-> 3  -> 6
  bipartation(G, l1, l2) == 1,
  one example of a bipartition for G is L1 = [1, 5, 3], L2 = [2, 4, 6]


  1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <---\
        ^           |
        |           |
        v           v 
        4 <-> 6 <-> 7 
  bipartition(G, l1, l2) == 0

int bipartition(Graph g, List l1, List l2) {

  return 0;
